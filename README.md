# LoginFields
Learning project to make the login screen of an app in the most modular way possible so that it supports unit testing

This app should do the followings:

1. As a user I am able to see when the app starts a screen with two text fields: email and password and a Login button
2. As a user I am able to type a email and when I tap on enter the password field becomes first responder.
3. As a user when I tap on enter from the password textfield the next validations will be made and I will see only one comprehensive error message:
Email:
    - the email must be valid
Password:
    - minimum of 6 characters
    - the first character must be uppercase
    - there should be a minumum of 1 non alpha numeric characters
    - there should be a minimum of 1 numeric characters
